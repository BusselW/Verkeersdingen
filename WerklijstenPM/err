# Error Log - Fixed

## Previous Issues (Resolved):
1. **React Error #31 - Invalid Date**: Fixed by adding proper date handling in Excel cell processing
2. **Babel Warning**: Documented and added error boundaries for better error handling

## Solutions Applied:
- Added proper Date object handling with try-catch blocks
- Implemented Error Boundary component to prevent app crashes
- Added safety checks for cell value rendering
- Enhanced error handling in Excel data processing

The application should now handle invalid dates gracefully and provide better error messages.
