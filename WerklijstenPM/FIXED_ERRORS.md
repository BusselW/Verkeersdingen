# Error Log - Issues Resolved

## Previous Issues (Resolved):
1. **React Error #31 - Invalid Date**: Fixed by adding proper date handling in Excel cell processing
2. **Babel Warning**: Documented and added error boundaries for better error handling

## Solutions Applied:
- Added proper Date object handling with try-catch blocks
- Implemented Error Boundary component to prevent app crashes
- Added safety checks for cell value rendering
- Enhanced error handling in Excel data processing

## Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced Date Handling**: Added specific handling for Date objects in Excel cells
2. **Error Boundary**: Created a React Error Boundary to catch and handle errors gracefully
3. **Safe Rendering**: Added safety checks to prevent React from trying to render invalid values
4. **Better Error Messages**: Improved error handling with more descriptive messages

The application should now handle invalid dates gracefully and provide better error messages.

## Next Steps for Production:
- Consider precompiling JSX instead of using Babel in-browser
- Add proper build process for better performance
- Consider using development vs production React builds
